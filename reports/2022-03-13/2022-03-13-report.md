# Report Week 02/20/22
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* watched/took extensive notes on DeepMind x UCL RL lecture series 2: Exploration and Exploitation
  * learned a lot about various algorithms for solving bandit problems including algorithms using action-value estimates and policy gradient algorithms
  * worked through some exercises such as deriving the policy updating scheme for softmax policy gradients via the REINFORCE trick
  * got to see a lot of the material I have been learning in my Bayesian Statistics course in practice in Bayesian approaches to bandits

## Issues/Problems
* was a little confused with exactly how Thompson Sampling worked and how it equates to Probability Matching

## Plans
* looking forward to actually playing around with openai gym this week (tomorrow?)
* I'm hoping to work on implementing RL algorithms
  * thinking of doing so in raycasting environment to see if I can get different results than Prof. Clark
  * possibly also might implement a Catan RL agent
* Hoping to work on transferring RL agent to modified test environments
  * for raycasting environment this may mean different textures
    * however this would focus more on the visual input of the problem rather than the strategic aspect
  * for Catan this may mean applying the agent to the expansion pack
    * this would be especially interesting since it would help determine whether the strategies in the original Catan can be applied directly to the expansion pack or whether the agent would have to 'rethink' its strategy
