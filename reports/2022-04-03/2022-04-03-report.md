# Report Week 03/27/22
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* worked more with the OpenAI Gym API in a variety of environments including Atari games
* implemented the Q-learning algorithm and successfully trained an agent to solve the Taxi environment

## Issues/Problems
None!

## Plans
* implement other RL algorithms besides plain Q-learning such as DQN and do so on other more complicated environments
* watch/take notes on DeepMind x UCL RL lecture series 3: MDPs and Dynamic Programming
* I'm hoping to work on implementing RL algorithms
  * thinking of doing so in raycasting environment to see if I can get different results than Prof. Clark
  * possibly also might implement a Catan RL agent
* Hoping to work on transferring RL agent to modified test environments
  * for raycasting environment this may mean different textures
    * however this would focus more on the visual input of the problem rather than the strategic aspect
  * for Catan this may mean applying the agent to the expansion pack
    * this would be especially interesting since it would help determine whether the strategies in the original Catan can be applied directly to the expansion pack or whether the agent would have to 'rethink' its strategy
