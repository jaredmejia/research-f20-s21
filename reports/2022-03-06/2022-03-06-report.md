# Report Week 02/20/22
## Activities/Accomplishments and Concepts/Lessons Learned
* got mujoco and openai gym to work on linux
* watched/took notes on DeepMind x UCL RL lecture series 1: Introduction to RL
  * a bit of review for me, but it was outlined well and further grounded my understanding of the field

## Issues/Problems
* had some problems with mujoco/gym to start but got it to work thanks to Prof. Clark :)

## Plans
* looking forward to actually playing around with openai gym this week
* I'm hoping to work on implementing RL algorithms
  * thinking of doing so in raycasting environment to see if I can get different results than Prof. Clark
  * possibly also might implement a Catan RL agent
* Hoping to work on transferring RL agent to modified test environments
  * for raycasting environment this may mean different textures
    * however this would focus more on the visual input of the problem rather than the strategic aspect
  * for Catan this may mean applying the agent to the expansion pack
    * this would be especially interesting since it would help determine whether the strategies in the original Catan can be applied directly to the expansion pack or whether the agent would have to 'rethink' its strategy
* hoping to eventually get through all of the DeepMind x UCL RL lectures (~1 a week)
  * supplementing with Sutton RL reading as it gets more complicated
